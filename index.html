		<!-- About Me -->
		<div id="about-me">I have been involved in the liquor industry for more than 25 years, 13 of those as owner/operator of a high-traffic club across the street from The Ohio State University campus and a restaurant in Powell, Ohio. I have experienced first hand many of the same issues Ohio liquor permit holders and applicants face today.

Since earning my law degree from Capital University, I have focused my practice on Ohio liquor law. My clients include retail and wholesale businesses throughout the state that sell beer, wine and alcohol. I represent current Ohio liquor permit holders, applicants for new liquor permits, and applicants for permit transfers.

I am ready to put my experience to work for you as your Ohio Liquor Lawyer.</div>
