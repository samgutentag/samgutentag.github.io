	<div id="heading">About Me</div>

	<div id="body">
		<div id="body">Hello! My name is Sam Gutentag.  I am employed at Industrial Light & Magic as a Junior Creature Technical Director working on Cloth and Rigid Simulations.  I graduated from The Ohio State University in 2013 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Information Systems, specializing in Animation, Game Development & Graphic Arts.</div>

	<div id="heading">Background & Current Work</div>

	<div id="body">
		<div id="body">Currently I am assigned to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3949660/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2</a> working with the layout department to collect data from set shoots to aid in the digital recreation work done in post production.  As such I am building out my skill set across multiple disciplines in the ILM Pipeline.  After principle photography has wrapped I will be staying on the show as a Jr Creature TD.</div>

		<div id="body">Prior to that, I was working on the upcoming Lionsgate film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0803096/">Warcraft</a>, creating simulations for several Orcs and Knight fight animations that will be used to help flesh out large battle sequences. I was also tasked with supporting other Creature Artist's shots and Animator tools.</div>

		<div id="body">I have an incredible passion for Visual Effects and the movie industry. While in school I was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to work on several major motion pictures with Visual Effects teams from Industrial Light & Magic, Digital Domain, and Marvel Studios.</div>
	
		<div id="body">I am a self starter. My education from The Ohio State University provided me with a base of skills that I have used to build my education and abilities past graduation. Since graduation, I have taught myself Python, HTML and CSS for the development of this website.</div>
	
		<div id="body">Outside of work I am working to learn Swift for hobby iOS apps, and am learning various web languages to round out my skill sets.  I have incredible passion to learn and discover as much as I can in the fields of Computer Science, Visual Effects, Web Design, Photography, and really just about everything else tech and visual based.</div>
