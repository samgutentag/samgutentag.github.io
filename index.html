	<div id="body">
		<div id="body">Hello! My name is Sam Gutentag.  I am employed at Industrial Light & Magic as a Junior Creature Technical Director working on Cloth and Rigid Simulations.  I graduated from The Ohio State University in 2013 with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Information Systems, specializing in Animation, Game Development & Graphic Arts.</div>

	<div id="heading">Background & Current Work</div>

	<div id="body">
		<div id="body">I have an incredible passion for Visual Effects and the movie industry. I am fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to work on several major motion pictures with Visual Effects teams from Industrial Light & Magic, WETA Digital, Scanline VFX, and Gentle Giant Studios. Prior to my senior year at Ohio State, I earned an internship at Lucas Film in San Francisco, California, where I worked with the Media Systems Engineering Team.</div>
	
		<div id="body">I am a self starter. My education from The Ohio State University provided me with a base of skills that I have used to build my education and abilities past graduation. Since graduation, I have taught myself Python, HTML and CSS for the development of this website.</div>
	
		<div id="body">Outside of work I am working to learn Swift for hobby iOS apps, and am learning various web languages to round out my skill sets.  I have incredible passion to learn and discover as much as I can in the fields of Computer Science, Visual Effects, Web Design, Photography, and really just about everything else tech and visual based.</div>
