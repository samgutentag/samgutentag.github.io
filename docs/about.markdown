I am a Developer Support Engineer, Tinkerer, Home Chef, Husband (and soon to be Father) living and working in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Born and raised in Columbus, Ohio I am a 2013 graduate of The Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Information Systems, Animation and Game Development.

Previously I was a Creature Technical Director and Location Matchmove Artist at [Industrial Light & Magic][ilm], and I currently work for Penumbra, Inc as part of the [REAL System VR][real-vr] Development Team.

Keep up with my public facing work, and a few side projects, on [Github][github] and via [blog posts][blog] on this site.

The font used for headers on this site is [National Park Typeface][typeface] (and I love it).
