## Gutentag, World!

Hi, I'm Sam Gutentag. I am the Developer Relations Lead at [Helium
Foundation][helium-foundation-website], a Tinkerer, a Data Enthusiast, a decent Home Chef, a Husband
and a Father living and working in the San Francisco Bay Area.

<!-- Born and raised in Columbus, Ohio I am a 2013 graduate of The Ohio State University with a Bachelor
of Arts in Computer Information Systems, Animation and Game Development. -->

Keep up with my public facing work, and a few side projects, on [Github][github] and via [blog
posts][blog] on this site.

> The font used for headers on this site is [National Park Typeface][typeface] (and I love it).
