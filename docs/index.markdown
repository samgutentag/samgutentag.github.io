## Gutentag, World

I am a Developer Support Engineer, Tinkerer, Data Enthusiast, Home Chef, Husband (and soon to be Father) living and working in the San Francisco Bay Area.

When I’m not working, you’ll find me tinkering with my 3D printer, building home projects in my garage, practicing a new recipe or home chef skill, playing with my two dogs, reading up on how to be a parent, and spending time with my wife (preferably outside, and with a [Helium Mapper][helium-mapper]).

Born and raised in Columbus, Ohio I am a 2013 graduate of The Ohio State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Information Systems, Animation and Game Development.

Previously I was a Creature Technical Director and Location Matchmove Artist at [Industrial Light & Magic][ilm], and I currently work as a Developer Support Engineer at Penumbra, Inc as part of the [REAL System VR][real-vr] Development Team.

Keep up with my public facing work, and a few side projects, on [Github][github] and via [blog posts][blog] on this site.

The font used for headers on this site is [National Park Typeface][typeface] (and I love it).
