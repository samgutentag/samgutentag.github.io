## Gutentag, World

I am a Developer Relations Lead at [Nova Labs][nova-website], Tinkerer, Data Enthusiast, Home Chef,
Husband and Father living and working in the San Francisco Bay Area.

When I’m not working, you’ll find me tinkering with my 3D printer, working on home projects in my
garage, practicing a new recipe or home chef skill, playing with my two dogs, reading up on how to
be a parent, and spending time with my wife (preferably outside, and with a [Helium
Mapper][helium-mapper]).

Born and raised in Columbus, Ohio I am a 2013 graduate of The Ohio State University with a Bachelor
of Arts in Computer Information Systems, Animation and Game Development.

Keep up with my public facing work, and a few side projects, on [Github][github] and via [blog
posts][blog] on this site.
