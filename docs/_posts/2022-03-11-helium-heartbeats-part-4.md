## Notifications with Pushover

This setup uses two [Pushover][pushover-website] Apps to communicate `Timely` and `Status Change` updates.

This can be setup with any number of PushOver Apps, though these two provide a useful balance of information.

To get started, head over to the [Pushover Website][pushover-website] and create an account if you do not already have one.

> To match my setup, you will need to purchase the [Pushover App for iOS][pushover-ios] application, which is free to use for 30 days, but requires a one time $5 purchase for a lifetime unlock on each platform (desktop/android/ios). Its worth it, seriously. For more information see [Pushover's Pricing][pushover-pricing]

Once you have a Pushover account, lets create some API Keys.
