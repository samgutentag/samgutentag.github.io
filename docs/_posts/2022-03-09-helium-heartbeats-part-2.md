# Collecting Data with the Helium API

This tutorial assumes you have some programming experience, but I aim to make this as straightforward as possible. It is a personal project to serve a need in my life but please make pull requests and feature suggestions on Github and I would love to help out!

## Github Repo

You can find the code for this project on [github][github-repo], clone the repo to follow along and run the script yourself!

[github-repo]: https://github.com/samgutentag/helium-heartbeat

## Set Up your Development Virtual Environment

I [wrote a blog post][virtual-env-blog] on the basics of setting up python virtual environments, assuming you have `mkvirtualenv` installed you can run this command to get started.

[virtual-env-blog]: https://gutentag.co/3sVfKZW

```bash
> mkvirtualenv -p python3 helium-heartbeat
```

Your shell output should be similar to this:

![shell output][shell-output-image-file]

[shell-output-image-file]: https://github.com/samgutentag/helium-heartbeat/blob/main/_assets/env-setup-shell-output.png?raw=true

### Store Your Environment Variables

When you create your virtual environment take note of where the `/postactivate` and `/predeactivate` files are located. You should edit these to store your private keys and any other information you do not want published to the internet.

#### Edit the `/postactvate` file

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
# This hook is sourced after this virtualenv is activated.
# ~/$HOME/.virtualenvs/helium-heartbeat/bin/postactvate

# sample address - this is not a real wallet address, just an example
export WALLET_ADDR="95a73802f8434c51a2bec3c8789cac7aa32f63793b8a4374a64"
```

#### Edit the `/predeactivate` file

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
# This hook is sourced before this virtualenv is deactivated.
# ~/$HOME/.virtualenvs/helium-heartbeat/bin/predeactivate

unset WALLET_ADDR
```

Create a directory, or clone the repo, navigate to it and activate the virtual environment and lets get started

> Quick Check! run `> printenv | grep WALLET` to ensure your environment variables are set correctly! it will be printed to the console if everything is ready to go.

### Install the Requirements

Once inside your script directory, be sure to install the requirements, I tried to keep it as lightweight as possible.

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set Your Headers

We need to create some helpers to poll the Helium API in the `helium_api_wrapper.py` script.

Please be nice to the HeliumAPI, if you poll too quickly you will be throttled or denied access, this header makes you "unique" in the eyes of the API, keeping you out of the general pool of users accessing the API.

The `HEADERS` will populate with information from your host system, the file name and the script file version.

Please feel free to adjust this as you see fit, the important bits are a `User-Agent` and `From`.

```python
HEADERS = {
    "User-Agent": f"solitaryPixels_{basename(__file__)}/{__version__}",
    "From": f"{getlogin()}.{basename(__file__)}@heliumheartbeat.com",
}
```

## The "helium_api_wrapper.py" Script

Now the fun begins! I've included some helper functions to keep things as simple and long term reusable as possible.

The Helium API is vast and you can read up on the [Helium Docs][helium-docs] for more detailed information, this quick tutorial is barely scraping the surface.

## Getting Hotspots Associated With A Wallet

We can now make a request to the Helium API. Open the `helium_api_wrapper.py` file and take a look.

### The "hotspots_for_account()" Function

This function uses the `requests` module to parse the API data and takes 4 arguments:

| param       | info                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address`   | Helium wallet address                                         |
| `cursor`    | String key used to step through the paginated api results     |
| `max_depth` | Maximum number of `cursors` that will be used when paginating |
| `api_url`   | Baseurl for the API, defaults to the production API           |

```python
def hotspots_for_account(address, cursor="", max_depth=3, api_url="api.helium.io"):
    baseurl = f"https://{api_url}/v1/accounts/{address}/hotspots"
    depth = 0
    while True and depth < max_depth:
        depth += 1
        _url = f"{baseurl}?cursor={cursor}"
        r = requests.get(_url, headers=HEADERS).json()
        try:
            for record in r["data"]:
                yield record
            cursor = r["cursor"]
        except KeyError:
            break
```

This function is a little fancy, it uses the `cursor` to step through the pagination of the API results, though I have not used this script on a wallet with more than 20 or so hotspots, this should be pretty quick.

## Getting Hotspot Activity

Once we get our list of Hotspots, we will need to check each one for the most recent activity, this little function does just that!

It uses the same method to paginate the API results using a `cursor`, though we only want the single most recent activity, so the `max_depth` is set to a shallow `2` to speed things up, and be nice to the Helium API.

### The "hotspot_activity()" Function

This function uses the `requests` module to parse the API data and takes 4 arguments:

| param       | info                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address`   | Helium Hotspot address                                        |
| `cursor`    | String key used to step through the paginated api results     |
| `max_depth` | Maximum number of `cursors` that will be used when paginating |
| `api_url`   | Baseurl for the API, defaults to the production API           |

```python
def hotspot_activity(address, cursor="", max_depth=2, api_url="api.helium.io"):
    baseurl = f"https://{api_url}/v1/hotspots/{address}/roles"
    depth = 0
    while True and depth < max_depth:
        depth += 1
        _url = f"{baseurl}?cursor={cursor}"
        r = requests.get(_url, headers=HEADERS).json()

        try:
            for record in r["data"]:
                yield record
            cursor = r["cursor"]
        except KeyError:
            break
```

## Capture Wallet Heartbeats with "helium-heartbeats.py"

In the [first post of this series][helium-heartbeat-part-1] I outlined what exactly a "Heartbeat" is considered to be, but the short version is an activity/infomration check for a given Hotspot. The next few steps take a multithreaded approach to get the heartbeat of each individual hotspots accosiated to a given Helium Wallet.

The `get_wallet_heartbeat()` function does a lot of the heavy lifting.

```python
get_wallet_heartbeat(wallet_addr=os.environ["WALLET_ADDR"]):
    """Get heartbeat data for all hotspots in a given wallet.

    Multithreaded collection of heartbeat data for all hotspots associated to
    a given wallet

    Args:
        wallet_addr (string): a wallet address on the Helium Blockchain

    Returns:
        result (dict): dictionary of hotspots heartbeat data

    Raises:
        Exception: broad exception for when the Helium API fails to
                    return a list of hotspots for the given wallet
    """
```

### Step 1. Get List of Hotspots For Wallet

This first step uses the Environment Variable `WALLET_ADR` to poll the API using the helper function `hotspots_for_account()` descripbed above. This gives us a list of hotspots to check.

```python
# get list of hotspots for wallet address
wallet_hotspots = helium_api_wrapper.hotspots_for_account(address=os.environ["WALLET_ADDR"])
```

### Step 2. Check Hotspot Heartbeats

Next take a multithreading approach to speed up checking on each Hotspot, this was developed with a smaller number of hotspots in mind (less than 10). Anything more than a handful of hotspots may take a while to complete.

For each hotspot associated with the target wallet, the `get_hotspot_heartbeat()` function makes use of the helper function`hotspot_activity()` to collect relevant data of the Hotspot and the reported block chain height.

```python
# split work into threads
threads = []
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=20) as executor:
    for hotspot in wallet_hotspots:
        threads.append(executor.submit(get_hotspot_heartbeat, hotspot))

# parse data from threads
heartbeats = {}
for task in threads:
    heartbeat = task.result()
    heartbeats[heartbeat["name"]] = heartbeat
```

We collect the blockchain height with every hotspot as a simplified safeguard for API drift issues. These values are collected and the maximum is taken as the `block_height_max` to simplify comparisons.

```python
# get max block reported
block_heights = []
for name in sorted(heartbeats.keys()):
    block_heights.append(heartbeats[name]["chain_height"])
block_height_max = max(block_heights)
```

### Step 3. Calculate the Activity Gaps

Once we have all of the heartbeat data for each hotspot, the `heartbeats[name]["blocks_inactive"]` key can be calculated by subtracting the `heartbeats[name]["latest_activity_block"]` from the `block_height_max`.

```python

# calculate inactive gap for each hotspot
for name in sorted(heartbeats.keys()):
    if heartbeats[name]["latest_activity_block"] == -1:
        heartbeats[name]["blocks_inactive"] = -1
    else:
        heartbeats[name]["blocks_inactive"] = (
            block_height_max - heartbeats[name]["latest_activity_block"]
        )
```

### Step 4. Store The Result

The `record_heartbeat_data()` function is used to reocrd the heartbeat data to a json file on the local machine.

```python
record_heartbeat_data(wallet_heartbeats=None):
    """Write heartbeat data to json files.

    Wallet heartbeat data is stored in JSON files for later processing
    and analysis.

    Args:
         wallet_heartbeats (dict): wallet heartbeats data

    Returns:
         info_file (string): output filepath to recorded json data

    """
```

Heartbeat data is stored in a `data` directory with `year` and `month` subdirectories.

A heartbeat collection run on March 5th, 2022 at 4:15pm would have the file path `./data/wallet_heartbeats/2022/03/heartbeat-2022.03.05-16.15.json`

Note that the timestamp is taken in the machine local time zone.

## Wrap Up

And there you have it! A small script to check the activity gap of the Hotspots associated with a given Helium Wallet!

This is a nice snapshot, but we should run this frequently to track this over time (and make some insightful charts!) You can check the blog post [Monitor Helium Hotspot Activity Part 4, Notifications with Pushover][helim-heartbeat-part-4] for information on using `cron` to schedule the script at different intervals.
