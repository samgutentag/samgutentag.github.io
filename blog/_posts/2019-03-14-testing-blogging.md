Consider this my initial commit to actually for real trying to blog my wreckless stumblings through the internet and other things.

I do not right away have a _real_ intention for this blog beyond record keeping for myself and ideally writing out tutorials of the things I do/redo often.

I've learned the lesson far too many times before not to commit to any kind of schedule, it just puts pressure on me that I don't act upon or handle well.  So for now, enjoy these posts as they come!

I also have a post or two over on my [Medium Blog][samgutentag-medium] that I will eventually migrate over here, or at least link to here and have copies of those posts I will keep up to date/change logged.
